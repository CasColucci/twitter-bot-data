# twitter-bot-data
A sampling program that gathers tweets on specific topics and generates an estimated bot engagement score

This is (going to be) an edit of a project I finished a few months ago to make it more available to anyone interested in using it. 

I'll need to fix some of the old issues and remove my current keys for the program before I actually put anything in this repo but it uses the [Botometer Python Library](https://github.com/IUNetSci/botometer-python)
